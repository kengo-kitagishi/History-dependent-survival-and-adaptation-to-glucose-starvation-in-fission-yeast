\section{Experimental results}
Here, we study carbon-starved \textit{Schizosaccharomyces pombe} in EMM

1)To examine the effect of glucose starvation, we employed live-cell microscopy to monitor 
2)To better understand the dynamics of the cell starving We imaged indivisual starving yeast with live-cell, time-lapse microscopy and tracked viability (resume能力により)
